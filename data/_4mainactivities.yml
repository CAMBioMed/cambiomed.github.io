  CAMBioMed is a transdisciplinary project combining natural sciences (marine
  biology & ecology), technological sciences (computer sciences & engineering),
  and social sciences (social anthropology & environmental economics). The main
  activities are to develop an adaptive monitoring framework for Mediterranean
  rocky reefs and track large-scale and long-term ecosystem changes along
  environmental gradients; support upscaling of monitoring using innovative
  tools, such as drones, computer vision, and e-DNA metabarcoding; and promote
  the monitoring of biodiversity and ecosystem changes with citizen science and
  anthropological assessment of social, economic, and cultural contexts.
  CAMBioMed will co-develop the research activities by consulting stakeholders
  at different levels, from high-level policy stakeholders (e.g. national
  ministries) to case study stakeholders (e.g. local fishers) and the general
  population by means of interviews, focus groups and/or workshops. This
  engagement is built upon ongoing stakeholder interactions with partners in
  existing projects and citizen science initiatives that will be upscaled by
  CAMBioMed to design and develop the adaptive, relevant and useful monitoring
  framework. CAMBioMed will provide a more comprehensive assessment of ecosystem
  health, allowing for the monitoring program to evolve in response to changing
  conditions, and for decision-makers to answer critical questions related to
  biodiversity conservation in a changing Mediterranean Sea.
