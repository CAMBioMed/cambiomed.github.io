          Sylvaine is a Senior Researcher at Stazione Zoologica Anton Dohrn in
          Italy and the coordinator of CAMBioMed project. Sylvaine's research
          focuses on the study of the ecology, management, and monitoring of
          marine ecosystems in the Mediterranean Sea. Her main research activity
          has been focused on exploring biodiversity patterns, addressing
          ecological questions, assessing the effectiveness of marine protected

          Antonio is a Senior Researcher at Stazione Zoologica Anton Dohrn. He
          is a marine ecologist that specializes in marine conservation, fish
          ecology, small-scale fisheries and coastal socio-ecological systems.
          His research activities are primarily centred on 3 interrelated axes:
          Assessing the effectiveness of marine protected areas (MPAs) for
          conservation of natural populations and management of exploited fish
          stocks with a focus on governance and management elements; Estimating
          patterns of connectivity and dispersal and their effect on fish
          populations to design effective networks of MPAs; Investigating MPAs,
          small scale fisheries and fishing resources as a socio-ecological
          system integrating both natural and human components and providing
          ecosystem service. He had leading roles in multiple projects (such as
          MAPAFISH-MED, SPILLOVER-MED, GreenList for MPAs, Reconnect,
          FishMPABlue 2, FishMPABlue 2 Plus, Safenet, FEAMP Campania) on the

          Manfredi is a Researcher at Stazione Zoologica Anton Dohrn. His
          research interests are focused on the conservation of marine
          ecosystems that can be used to guide effective management of human
          activities. Through the study of fish ecology and behavior I am
          concerned with the design and effectiveness of Marine Protected Areas
          and the human activities associated with them, such as the management
          of artisanal fisheries. For the past 10 years I have been involved in
          the conservation of Mediterranean elasmobranchs with research ranging
          from the study of their biology and ecology to their spatial
          distribution. To investigate all of the above, I use various
          techniques and tools including visual census, acoustic telemetry,
          field experiments, laboratory activities, fishing vessel embarkations,
          systematic reviews, meta-analysis, and local ecological knowledge
          (LEK).

          My research activities focus on the study of marine ecosystem ecology
          and management, with particular attention to the conservation and
          restoration of degraded ecosystems. During my PhD, through underwater
          visual surveys, acoustic tagging, capture-recapture experiments, field
          experiments, analyses using a Before-After Control-Impact (BACI)
          design, and optimization algorithms, I evaluated the effects and
          effectiveness of a no-take zone located in the northwestern
          Mediterranean Sea, and how its positive effects also extended to
          adjacent fishing areas. In addition, my interests concern conservation
          planning, not only by identifying priority areas but also by defining
          where to establish new Marine Protected Areas.

          I am a community ecologist, interested in understanding how different
          drivers of global change are affecting marine ecosystems functioning.
          Most of my research is focused on direct and combined effects of major
          disturbance sources related to global change, such as pollution and
          global warming. I am also involved in the study of marine bioinvasions
          of macroalgae and their impacts on benthic ecosystems. By better
          understanding the ongoing threats to marine ecosystems, I can also
          direct my research towards the development and assessment of tools
          for restoration and conservation of macroalgal communities.

          I’m a marine ecologist specialized in invasion, trait-based and
          computational ecology. I am interested in the study of biodiversity
          patterns at regional or global scales, both taxonomically and
          functionally, and about how biodiversity has changed and been affected
          by global change. I did my thesis on the ecology of biological
          invasions, exploring how introduced species can establish themselves
          in new areas, what characteristics might give them an advantage over
          native species, and how ecological theory could be applied to improve
          prevention efforts for future invasions.

          Senior Researcher at Israel Oceanographic & Limnological Research
          (IOLR), and Associate Professor in the University of Haifa. Gil is a
          marine community ecologist and conservation biologist working mostly
          on coastal benthic ecosystems. He studies how coastal marine
          biodiversity, mostly that of rocky reefs, is and will be affected by
          climate change, bioinvasions and overfishing, using both monitoring
          and field and lab experiments. He also investigates how global and
          local stressors lead to the alteration of ecosystem functions and
          services, and studies the effectiveness of nature-based solutions.

          I'm a research assistant in a marine ecology lab studying
          canopy-forming brown algae and their role in shaping coastal
          ecosystems. A significant part of my work is dedicated to monitoring
          populations of these habitat-forming species, which create unique
          marine forest habitats along the Mediterranean coast. I have been
          investigating their morphology, phenology, reproductive cycles, and
          ecological functions to better understand their influence on community
          structure and ecosystem processes in rocky shore environments.

          Natalia Vasekha is a PhD student in Gil Rilov's marine community
          ecology lab. Her research focuses on comparing structural and
          functional changes in shallow macrophyte reef communities at two
          Eastern Mediterranean change hotspots: Israel and Cyprus. Using
          in-situ metabolic incubations, trait-based analysis, and monitoring of
          selected native and introduced species, she investigates the combined
          effects of warming and species invasions, and examines the roles and
          interactions of key reef species.
