          Manfredi is a Researcher at Stazione Zoologica Anton Dohrn. His
          research interests are focused on the conservation of marine
          ecosystems that can be used to guide effective management of human
          activities. Through the study of fish ecology and behavior I am
          concerned with the design and effectiveness of Marine Protected Areas
          and the human activities associated with them, such as the management
          of artisanal fisheries. For the past 10 years I have been involved in
          the conservation of Mediterranean elasmobranchs with research ranging
          from the study of their biology and ecology to their spatial
          distribution. To investigate all of the above, I use various
          techniques and tools including visual census, acoustic telemetry,
          field experiments, laboratory activities, fishing vessel embarkations,
          systematic reviews, meta-analysis, and local ecological knowledge
          (LEK).

          I am a community ecologist, interested in understanding how
          different drivers of global change are affecting marine ecosystems
          functioning. Most of my research is focused on direct and combined
          effects of major disturbance sources related to global change, such
          as pollution and global warming. I am also involved in the study of
          marine bioinvasions of macroalgae and their impacts on benthic
          ecosystems. By better understanding the ongoing threats to marine
          ecosystems, I can also direct my research towards the development
          and assessment of tools for restoration and conservation of
          macroalgal communities.

          I'm currently a senior researcher at the Institute of Marine
          Sciences of the Spanish Research Council (CSIC) in Barcelona
          (Spain). I'm applying a multidisciplinary approach to the study of
          climate change effects in the conservation of Mediterranean marine
          biodiversity. In this framework, I devoted most of my career to
          analysing the role of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) as tools to
          counteract the negative effects of human activities. I have also
          been especially active in developing collaborative initiatives to
          cope with large-scale and long-term scales unavoidable for the study
          of global change effects. As main milestones of these initiatives,
          I'm coordinating and promoting collaborative networks of observation
          of the current warming trend in the Mediterranean, mainly supported
          by <a href="https://www.t-mednet.org/">MPA's managers</a> and

        bio: |
          I am a marine ecologist interested in the conservation and restoration
          of coastal marine ecosystems threatened by human activities. I
          recently defended my thesis at the Centre d'Estudis AvanÃ§ats de Blanes
          (CEAB-CSIC), supervised by Dr Emma Cebrian and funded by FundaciÃ³n
          Tatiana PÃ©rez de GuzmÃ¡n el Bueno. I am currently working on the
          evaluation of restoration success through ecosystem functions and
          services. I examine the recovery of macroalgal biodiversity using both
          traditional taxonomic and functional-trait approach. I also
          investigate the recovery of other groups of organisms, such as
          macroinvertebrates, using molecular techniques (metabarcoding), and
          ecosystem processes like primary production and respiration. During my
          PhD I have also collaborated on research projects aiming to understand
          the effects of habitat fragmentation on the biodiversity of marine
          forests. Much of my research is based in the Mediterranean Sea, but I
          also have experience in macroalgal ecology from the northeast Atlantic
          and southeast Australia.

          the Technical University (DTU), I have now returned to Catalonia to
          start a postdoctoral position at the CEAB. I am interested in the
          study of biodiversity patterns at regional or global scales, both
          taxonomically and functionally, and about how biodiversity has
          changed and been affected by global change. I did my thesis on the
          ecology of biological invasions, exploring how introduced species
          can establish themselves in new areas, what characteristics might
          give them an advantage over native species, and how ecological
          theory could be applied to improve prevention efforts for future
          invasions.

          Silvia Rayo joined the Future Oceans Lab team at the University of Vigo as
          a research assistant, contributing to various European projects. She holds
          a degree in Marine Sciences from the University of Barcelona, and a
          master's in Integrated Management of Coastal Areas from the University of

        contribution: |
          In CAMBioMed, she collaborates on Task 4.3 to assess stakeholder
          perceptions and engagement in marine citizen science. This involves
          coordinating regional consultations and conducting pre/post surveys to
          explore biocultural values, motivations, and changes in knowledge,
          attitudes, and values linked to participation in the adaptive monitoring
          of marine ecosystems.
